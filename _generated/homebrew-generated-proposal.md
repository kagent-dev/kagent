# **A Comprehensive Guide to Automating Homebrew Distribution for the kagent CLI**

## **Section 1: Strategic Overview and Foundational Analysis**

### **1.1 Executive Summary**

This report provides a definitive, end-to-end guide for creating a fully automated, sudo-less Homebrew distribution for the kagent-dev/kagent command-line interface (CLI) on macOS. The recommended solution leverages a dedicated Homebrew tap repository, populated automatically by a GoReleaser pipeline. This pipeline is executed via a GitHub Actions workflow triggered by new Git tags. This approach delivers a professional, secure, and maintainable distribution channel that aligns with modern DevOps best practices and supports the project's strategic goals.

### **1.2 Initial Project Analysis: kagent-dev/kagent**

The target for this distribution strategy is kagent-dev/kagent, an open-source framework designed to bring Agentic AI capabilities to cloud-native environments, with a specific focus on Kubernetes.1 The project is composed of several key components: a Kubernetes controller and CLI written in Go, an agentic engine built on Python, and a web-based user interface developed with TypeScript.2 This report focuses exclusively on packaging and distributing the Go-based CLI component.

A review of the project's repository and documentation indicates that the current primary installation method is a script downloaded via curl and executed with bash.4 There is no existing GoReleaser configuration (

.goreleaser.yml) or a dedicated release workflow for the CLI.2 This presents a greenfield opportunity to implement a robust, automated release process from the ground up, avoiding the complexities of migrating a legacy system.

The project's stated ambition to become a Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) sandbox project is a significant factor influencing the recommended strategy.1 A professional, community-friendly distribution channel like Homebrew is a hallmark of a mature, well-maintained open-source project. Adopting such a standard demonstrates a commitment to user experience and operational excellence, which are positive signals for a CNCF application. Moving away from a

curl | bash script, which is often viewed as less secure and more difficult to manage, toward a trusted package manager aligns directly with the CNCF's values of promoting easily adoptable and well-governed projects.1

### **1.3 Clarification: Distinguishing Between kagent Projects**

It is critical to distinguish the kagent-dev/kagent project from an unrelated suite of tools also named "KAgent." This other toolset is associated with Kinetica database and KACE Systems Management products and is distributed as RPM or DEB packages.5 This report pertains exclusively to the cloud-native AI framework from the

kagent-dev organization. This distinction is vital for avoiding confusion during any external research or troubleshooting.

### **1.4 Addressing the sudo-less Installation Requirement**

A primary requirement for this solution is that the installation and execution of kagent must not require sudo permissions. This constraint is inherently satisfied by adopting the standard Homebrew ecosystem. Modern Homebrew installations on macOS are designed to be entirely sudo-less. By default, Homebrew installs packages into a user-owned directory: /opt/homebrew for Apple Silicon machines and /usr/local for Intel-based machines (where permissions are adjusted for the user during the initial Homebrew setup).9 Consequently, any formula installed via Homebrew, including the one proposed in this report, will be installed and managed without elevated privileges, directly fulfilling this core requirement by design.

## **Section 2: Establishing the Homebrew Tap Repository**

### **2.1 Rationale: Custom Tap vs. homebrew-core**

Homebrew allows for software distribution through its main repository, homebrew-core, or through third-party repositories known as "taps".11 For the

kagent project, creating a custom tap is the strongly recommended approach for several strategic reasons:

* **Control and Speed:** The kagent-dev team retains complete and immediate control over the release lifecycle. Updates can be published instantly, synchronized with the main project's releases, without being subject to the pull request review process and potential delays of the homebrew-core repository.11  
* **Automation and Flexibility:** A custom tap provides the ideal target for a fully automated release pipeline. The GoReleaser configuration can be set to push formula updates directly to the tap repository. This model offers greater flexibility, as the formula requirements for custom taps are less stringent than those for homebrew-core.14  
* **Architectural Separation:** Establishing a dedicated tap repository creates a clear separation of concerns. The main kagent-dev/kagent repository contains the application source code, while the tap repository contains only the packaging metadata. This is a clean architectural pattern that simplifies maintenance, access control, and repository history. The main repository's commit log remains focused on source code, while the tap's history becomes a transparent log of releases.

| Feature | Custom Tap (kagent-dev/homebrew-kagent) | Core Repository (homebrew/core) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Release Control** | Full and immediate control by project maintainers | PR-based; requires approval from Homebrew maintainers |
| **Update Speed** | Instantaneous; synchronized with project tags | Subject to review queue and process delays |
| **Discoverability** | Lower; requires users to brew tap the repository first | Higher; searchable via brew search by default |
| **Maintenance** | Minimal; fully automated by the release workflow | Higher; requires creating and managing PRs |
| **Formula Flexibility** | High; allows for custom logic and fewer restrictions | Low; must adhere to strict formula guidelines |

### **2.2 Creating the Tap Repository**

A new public GitHub repository must be created within the kagent-dev organization to serve as the tap.

* **Naming Convention:** To leverage Homebrew's shorthand commands, the repository must follow the homebrew-<name> convention.11 The recommended name is  
  **homebrew-kagent**. This allows end-users to add the tap using the simple command brew tap kagent-dev/kagent.  
* **Repository Structure:** The repository must contain a directory named Formula in its root.11 This directory is the designated location where GoReleaser will automatically create and manage the  
  kagent.rb formula file. No other files or configurations are required for the initial setup of the tap repository.

### **2.3 User Interaction with the Tap**

The end-user workflow for installing kagent via the custom tap is straightforward and follows standard Homebrew patterns.

1. **Tapping the Repository:** A user first adds the tap to their local Homebrew installation. This is a one-time operation:  
   ```Bash  
   brew tap kagent-dev/kagent
   ```

2. **Installing the Formula:** Once the tap is added, the user can install the kagent CLI as they would any other Homebrew package:  
   ```Bash  
   brew install kagent
   ```
   Homebrew will automatically search the newly added tap, find the kagent.rb formula, and proceed with the installation.12 Subsequent updates are handled just as easily with  
   brew upgrade kagent, which will fetch the latest version available in the tap.15

## **Section 3: Configuring the GoReleaser Pipeline**

### **3.1 Introduction to GoReleaser**

GoReleaser is the industry-standard release automation tool for Go projects, designed to streamline the process of building multi-platform binaries, creating archives, and publishing release artifacts.16 Its native support for generating and publishing Homebrew formulae makes it the ideal tool for this solution.14

### **3.2 The .goreleaser.yml Configuration File**

The entire release process will be defined in a single YAML file named .goreleaser.yml, located in the root of the kagent-dev/kagent repository. This "Infrastructure as Code" approach makes the release process transparent, version-controlled, and repeatable. Any changes to the release process must go through a pull request, improving governance and preventing ad-hoc modifications to production releases. For enhanced editor support, a JSON schema link should be included at the top of the file 19:

```YAML
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://goreleaser.com/static/schema.json
```

### **3.3 Stanza-by-Stanza Configuration Breakdown**

The following configuration provides a complete and robust pipeline for the kagent CLI.

```YAML

#.goreleaser.yml

# Set the project name, used in artifact naming  
project_name: kagent

# Run hooks before the build process  
before:  
  hooks:  
    - go mod tidy

# Define the build configuration for the kagent CLI  
builds:  
  - id: kagent-cli  
    # Path to the main package of the CLI  
    main:./go/cmd/kagent  
    # Name of the output binary  
    binary: kagent  
    # Set environment variables for the build  
    env:  
      - CGO_ENABLED=0  
    # Specify target operating systems and architectures  
    goos:  
      - linux  
      - windows  
      - darwin  
    goarch:  
      - amd64  
      - arm64

# Create a universal "fat" binary for macOS  
universal_binaries:  
  - id: kagent-darwin  
    # Combine the darwin/amd64 and darwin/arm64 builds  
    ids:  
      - kagent-cli  
    # Remove the single-architecture macOS archives to avoid clutter  
    replace: true

# Define how artifacts are archived  
archives:  
  - format: tar.gz  
    # Use a consistent naming template for archives  
    name_template: >-  
      {{.ProjectName }}_{{.Version }}_{{.Os }}_{{.Arch }}

# Generate a checksum file for all artifacts  
checksum:  
  name_template: 'checksums.txt'

# Configure the GitHub Release creation  
release:  
  # Let GoReleaser generate release notes from commit messages  
  github:  
    owner: kagent-dev  
    name: kagent  
  prerelease: auto

# Configure the Homebrew tap publication  
homebrew_casks:  
  - name: kagent  
    # Specify the target tap repository  
    tap:  
      owner: kagent-dev  
      name: homebrew-kagent  
      # Use a secret token for secure cross-repository access  
      token: "{{.Env.HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN }}"  
      
    # Set the author for the automated commit  
    commit_author:  
      name: goreleaser-bot  
      email: bot@goreleaser.com

    # Metadata for the Homebrew formula  
    homepage: "https://kagent.dev/"  
    description: "Cloud Native Agentic AI | An open-source framework for DevOps and platform engineers to run AI agents in Kubernetes."  
    license: "apache-2.0"

    # A test block to verify the installation  
    test: |  
      system "#{bin}/kagent version"
```

**Key Configuration Points:**

* **builds:** This stanza defines the core build matrix. The main path is set to ./go/cmd/kagent based on the project's structure.2  
  CGO_ENABLED=0 is critical for enabling seamless cross-compilation for all target platforms.18  
* **universal_binaries:** This feature is essential for a modern macOS tool. It combines the darwin_amd64 (Intel) and darwin_arm64 (Apple Silicon) binaries into a single executable.20 This ensures that  
  brew install kagent works flawlessly for all macOS users, regardless of their hardware, significantly improving the onboarding experience. The replace: true option is used to keep the release assets clean by removing the now-redundant single-architecture archives.20  
* **homebrew_casks:** This is the core of the Homebrew integration. Note the use of the modern homebrew_casks block, which replaces the deprecated brews block.14 It specifies the target tap repository (  
  kagent-dev/homebrew-kagent) and uses an environment variable {{.Env.HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN }} for secure authentication.14 The  
  test block provides a crucial post-installation sanity check.23

## **Section 4: Automating Releases with a GitHub Actions Workflow**

### **4.1 The "Tag and Release" Workflow Model**

The automation pipeline is built on the "tag and release" model, a robust and widely adopted GitOps pattern.13 In this model, the act of a maintainer creating and pushing a new Git tag that matches a specific pattern (e.g.,

v1.2.3) serves as the trigger for the entire release process. This transforms the release process from a series of manual steps into a single, declarative Git operation.

### **4.2 Creating the Workflow File**

A new workflow file must be created at .github/workflows/release.yml in the main kagent-dev/kagent repository.

### **4.3 Workflow Configuration Breakdown**

The following YAML defines the GitHub Actions workflow that will execute the GoReleaser pipeline.

```YAML

#.github/workflows/release.yml

name: Release kagent CLI

# Trigger the workflow on pushes of tags starting with 'v'  
on:  
  push:  
    tags:  
      - 'v*'

# Define permissions for the GITHUB_TOKEN  
permissions:  
  contents: write

jobs:  
  goreleaser:  
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  
    steps:  
      # Step 1: Check out the repository code  
      - name: Checkout  
        uses: actions/checkout@v4  
        with:  
          # Fetch all history for all branches and tags  
          fetch-depth: 0

      # Step 2: Set up the Go environment  
      - name: Set up Go  
        uses: actions/setup-go@v5  
        with:  
          go-version: '1.21' # Adjust to match project's Go version

      # Step 3: Run the GoReleaser action  
      - name: Run GoReleaser  
        uses: goreleaser/goreleaser-action@v5  
        with:  
          # Use the latest version of GoReleaser  
          version: latest  
          # Execute the release command with the --clean flag  
          args: release --clean  
        env:  
          # GITHUB_TOKEN is automatically provided by GitHub Actions  
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}  
          # HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN is a custom secret for the tap repository  
          HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN }}
```

### **4.4 Security: Creating and Storing the HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN**

The security model for this workflow relies on two distinct tokens. The default, built-in GITHUB_TOKEN has permissions scoped only to the kagent-dev/kagent repository and is used to create the GitHub Release. To push the formula to the separate kagent-dev/homebrew-kagent repository, a second, custom token is required.21 This use of a narrowly-scoped token is a critical security best practice that adheres to the principle of least privilege.

**Steps to Create and Store the Token:**

1. **Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT):** Navigate to Developer settings on GitHub and generate a new fine-grained personal access token.24  
2. **Scope the Token:** The token must be scoped to have Contents: Read & Write permissions for **only** the kagent-dev/homebrew-kagent repository. No other permissions or repository access should be granted.  
3. **Store the Token as a Secret:** In the kagent-dev/kagent repository, navigate to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions. Create a new repository secret named HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN and paste the generated PAT as its value. The workflow will now have secure access to this token.

| Token / Secret | Purpose | Scope / Permissions | Source |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| GITHUB_TOKEN | Create GitHub Release and upload assets to kagent-dev/kagent. | contents: write on kagent-dev/kagent. | Provided automatically by GitHub Actions. |
| HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN | Commit and push the updated Homebrew formula to kagent-dev/homebrew-kagent. | contents: read & write on kagent-dev/homebrew-kagent **only**. | Manually generated PAT stored as a repository secret. |

## **Section 5: End-User Experience: Installation and Verification**

### **5.1 First-Time Installation**

The resulting end-user experience is simple, familiar, and professional, significantly lowering the barrier to entry compared to manual scripts. The process involves two commands:

1. **Tap the repository (one-time setup):**  
   Bash  
   brew tap kagent-dev/kagent

2. **Install the CLI:**  
   Bash  
   brew install kagent

Behind the scenes, Homebrew performs a series of actions: it clones the homebrew-kagent tap, reads the kagent.rb formula, securely downloads the correct universal binary (.tar.gz) from the GitHub Release assets, verifies its SHA256 checksum against the one in the formula, extracts the binary, and places it into the user's PATH at /opt/homebrew/bin or /usr/local/bin.

### **5.2 Upgrading kagent**

Managing updates is equally seamless. Users can upgrade to the latest version of kagent with a single command:

Bash

brew upgrade kagent

The brew update command (often run automatically or as part of brew upgrade) pulls the latest changes to the kagent-dev/homebrew-kagent tap, making Homebrew aware of the new version. The upgrade command then handles the download and replacement of the old binary.15 This provides a trusted, standardized mechanism for version management.

### **5.3 Post-Installation Verification: The test do Block**

To provide immediate feedback and confidence to the user, the Homebrew formula includes a test do block.10 This block contains a small script that Homebrew automatically executes after a successful installation. The test defined in the

.goreleaser.yml configuration is:

Ruby

test do  
  system "#{bin}/kagent version"  
end

This simple test runs the kagent version command and asserts that it exits with a status code of 0 (success). This confirms that the binary is correctly installed, is executable, and responds to a basic command without errors.

This automated verification is a significant improvement over manual methods. It proves to the user that the tool is ready for use, completing a high-quality installation experience that encourages adoption among the target audience of DevOps and platform engineers, who value robust and reliable tooling.25

## **Section 6: Final Recommendations and Operational Best Practices**

### **6.1 Conclusive Summary**

The implemented solution provides a secure, fully automated release pipeline for the kagent CLI. By leveraging GoReleaser and GitHub Actions to publish to a dedicated Homebrew tap, the system meets all requirements, including the critical constraint of a sudo-less installation. This process elevates the project's distribution method to a professional standard, befitting its ambition for CNCF inclusion. The entire system is self-documenting, with the .goreleaser.yml file defining the release artifacts and the .github/workflows/release.yml file defining the release process, reducing knowledge silos and making the project more maintainable.

### **6.2 Versioning and Tagging Strategy**

Strict adherence to **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)** is strongly recommended. GoReleaser and Homebrew both rely on well-formed version tags (e.g., v1.2.3, v1.3.0-rc1) to function correctly.26 The official release process for maintainers should be to create and push an annotated Git tag:

Bash

# Example for creating release v0.1.0  
git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Release v0.1.0"  
git push origin v0.1.0

Using an annotated tag (-a) is a best practice as it stores extra metadata, including the author, date, and a message.

### **6.3 Maintenance and Troubleshooting**

* **Workflow Failures:** If a release workflow fails, the first step is to inspect the logs of the goreleaser job in the GitHub Actions tab. Common failure points include an expired or incorrectly scoped HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN, misconfigurations in the .goreleaser.yml file, or upstream network issues.  
* **Formula Audits:** To ensure the generated formula continues to meet Homebrew's evolving standards, it is good practice to periodically run brew audit --tap kagent-dev/kagent.  
* **Dependency Updates:** The goreleaser/goreleaser-action in the workflow file should be pinned to a major version (e.g., @v5).26 This provides a balance of receiving non-breaking updates while protecting against major version changes that could disrupt the workflow.

### **6.4 Future Enhancements**

This robust pipeline serves as a strong foundation that can be extended with further security and quality-of-life improvements.

* **Binary Signing and Notarization:** To fully comply with macOS security standards and eliminate Gatekeeper warnings about "unidentified developers," the project should consider signing its binaries. This requires an Apple Developer Program membership. GoReleaser has built-in support for code signing and notarization. As an intermediate step, the homebrew_casks block can be modified to include a post_install hook that programmatically removes the quarantine attribute from the binary, though this is less secure than full notarization.21  
* **SLSA Provenance:** To enhance software supply chain security, the workflow can be integrated with tools like slsa-github-generator. This would allow GoReleaser to generate SLSA (Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts) provenance attestations for all release artifacts. This provides a verifiable, cryptographic trail of how the software was built, significantly strengthening the project's security posture and further bolstering its CNCF application.27
