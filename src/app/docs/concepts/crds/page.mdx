# Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)

KAgent uses several Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) to manage its components in Kubernetes. These CRDs allow you to define and manage KAgent resources declaratively using Kubernetes manifests.

## Available CRDs

KAgent provides the following CRDs:

- [Agent](./agent) - Defines individual AI agents
- [Team](./team) - Groups multiple agents into a team
- [Memory](./memory) - Configures agent memory and storage
- [ModelConfig](./model-config) - Defines LLM model configurations
- [ToolServer](./tool-server) - Manages tool server configurations

## Installation

The CRDs are automatically installed when you deploy KAgent using Helm:

```bash
helm install kagent kagent/kagent
```

Or you can install just the CRDs:

```bash
helm install kagent-crds kagent/kagent-crds
```

## Usage

Each CRD has its own configuration options and use cases. Click on the links above to learn more about each CRD type and how to use them.

## Best Practices

1. Always specify a namespace for your CRDs
2. Use meaningful names for your resources
3. Follow the examples in each CRD's documentation
4. Use version control for your CRD manifests
5. Test your configurations in a non-production environment first

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with CRDs:

1. Check the CRD installation status:
   ```bash
   kubectl get crds | grep kagent.dev
   ```

2. Verify the CRD definitions:
   ```bash
   kubectl get crd <crd-name> -o yaml
   ```

3. Check for any validation errors in your manifests
4. Ensure you have the correct permissions to create/update CRDs
