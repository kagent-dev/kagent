name: Global Tech Stack
description: Understand the comprehensive technology stack for the Kagent Kubernetes-native AI agent framework including Go controller/API, Python agent runtimes, and Next.js web UI. Use this skill when working with the Go backend stack (Go 1.25.1, Gorilla Mux for HTTP routing, GORM ORM with PostgreSQL for production and SQLite for development, Cobra CLI framework, Viper configuration, Kubernetes client-go), when working with Python agent runtimes (Python 3.11.0+, uv package manager, Google ADK/LangGraph/CrewAI agent frameworks, a2a-sdk for Agent-to-Agent communication, httpx for async HTTP, pydantic for validation, openai/anthropic/google-genai/litellm for LLM providers), when working with the Next.js frontend stack (Next.js 15.4.7 with App Router and Turbopack, React 18.3.1, TypeScript 5.8.3, Tailwind CSS 3.4.17, Radix UI primitives for accessible components, class-variance-authority for variants, react-hook-form with zod validation, zustand for state management, @a2a-js/sdk for agent communication), when understanding database architecture (PostgreSQL production with gorm.io/driver/postgres, SQLite development with github.com/glebarez/sqlite, GORM ORM with auto-migration and JSON datatypes), when working with testing frameworks (Go testing with testify assertions, pytest with pytest-asyncio for Python, Jest with @testing-library/react for frontend unit tests, Cypress for E2E tests), when deploying on Kubernetes (custom Agent/ModelConfig/ToolServer CRDs, controller pattern, Prometheus metrics with github.com/prometheus/client_golang, OpenTelemetry tracing), when integrating with LLM providers (OpenAI GPT models, Anthropic Claude models, Google Vertex AI and Gemini, Azure OpenAI, Ollama local deployment, custom OpenAI-compatible APIs via litellm), when using MCP (Model Context Protocol) with github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go for Go and mcp SDK for Python to integrate tool servers (Kubernetes, Istio, Helm, Argo, Prometheus, Grafana, Cilium), when configuring environment variables (DATABASE_URL, SQLITE_PATH, PORT, LOG_LEVEL for Go; KAGENT_URL, STS_WELL_KNOWN_URI for Python; NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL, NEXT_PUBLIC_USER_ID for frontend), when managing dependencies (go mod tidy for Go modules, uv pip install with pyproject.toml for Python, npm with package.json for Node.js), when understanding the monorepo structure (go/ for controller/API/CLI, python/packages/ for agent runtimes, ui/ for Next.js web UI, agent-os/standards/ for coding standards), or when working with development tools (Make for Go builds, ruff for Python formatting/linting, ESLint for TypeScript linting, golangci-lint for Go linting). This skill provides comprehensive knowledge of all technologies, frameworks, libraries, and tools used across the Kagent multi-language platform.
