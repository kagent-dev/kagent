name: Testing Test Writing
description: Write minimal, strategic tests for critical user flows using Go testing with testify, pytest with async support, and Jest with React Testing Library. Use this skill when writing Go tests with the standard testing package and testify/assert for assertions following the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern, when implementing Go table-driven tests with []struct test cases and t.Run for subtests, when mocking Go interfaces by creating mock structs with function fields for dependency injection, when writing Python tests with pytest and pytest-asyncio for async function testing using @pytest.mark.asyncio decorator, when parametrizing Python tests with @pytest.mark.parametrize for multiple test cases with descriptive IDs, when creating Python test fixtures with @pytest.fixture decorator for reusable mock objects, when mocking Python HTTP clients with unittest.mock.Mock and configuring return values for different status codes, when writing React component tests with @testing-library/react using render, screen queries (getByRole, getByText), and userEvent for simulating user interactions, when testing async React components with waitFor to wait for loading states and data to appear, when mocking API calls in TypeScript tests using MSW (Mock Service Worker) with setupServer and rest.get/post handlers, when writing Cypress E2E tests that visit pages, interact with elements using data-testid attributes, and verify URL changes and success messages, when testing only critical user workflows and core business logic during development (defer edge cases and non-critical utilities), when following the testing philosophy to write minimal tests during development and focus on completing features first, when testing behavior not implementation to reduce test brittleness, when using clear descriptive test names (TestFunctionName_Scenario_ExpectedBehavior for Go, test_function_name_scenario_expected_behavior for Python, describe/it blocks for TypeScript), when ensuring test independence with no shared state and proper setup/teardown, when mocking external dependencies (APIs, databases, file systems) but not the system under test, when keeping unit tests fast (< 100ms) for frequent execution, integration tests reasonable (< 5s), and E2E tests slower (< 30s), when prioritizing tests for critical workflows, business logic, and error handling on critical paths over utilities and simple UI components, or when avoiding tests for third-party library code, auto-generated code, configuration files, and obvious functionality. This skill ensures strategic test coverage focused on critical paths with fast, isolated, maintainable tests across all three languages.
