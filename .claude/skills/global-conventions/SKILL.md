name: Global Conventions
description: Follow project-wide conventions for version control, dependency management, file organization, security, and development workflow in the Kagent multi-language monorepo. Use this skill when writing commit messages following Conventional Commits format (feat/fix/docs/style/refactor/test/chore with scope and subject), when organizing the multi-language monorepo with go/ for controller and API server, python/packages/ for agent runtime integrations (kagent-adk, kagent-langgraph, kagent-crewai), ui/ for Next.js web interface, and agent-os/standards/ for coding standards, when managing Go dependencies with go mod tidy and go.mod, when managing Python dependencies with uv pip install and pyproject.toml, when managing Node.js dependencies with npm and package.json, when organizing Go packages with internal/ for private packages and pkg/ for public packages following one package per directory with matching names, when organizing Python packages with leading underscore for private modules (_a2a.py, _session_service.py) and public API exposed in __init__.py, when organizing TypeScript/React files with PascalCase for components (ChatInterface.tsx, AgentCard.tsx) and feature-based organization with shared UI components in components/ui/, when configuring environment variables using .env files for local development (never commit secrets) with .env.example as template without secrets, when handling secrets through environment variables like DATABASE_URL, KAGENT_URL, NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL, NEXT_PUBLIC_USER_ID, when implementing feature flags for gradual rollouts or incomplete features (viper.GetBool in Go, os.getenv in Python), when creating pull requests with clear descriptions, issue references, passing CI checks, and addressing code review feedback, when conducting code reviews by checking logic correctness, readability, test coverage, and adherence to project standards, when ensuring tests pass before merging (unit tests, integration tests, linting), when following security best practices like never committing secrets, validating all input server-side, using parameterized queries, implementing authentication and authorization, when following performance considerations like indexing database columns, implementing pagination, lazy loading, caching, and avoiding N+1 queries, when following accessibility requirements for WCAG AA compliance with keyboard navigation and screen readers, when maintaining clear file naming conventions (snake_case for Python files, PascalCase for TypeScript components, lowercase for Go files), or when organizing code within files with imports first, then constants, types, constructors, then methods/functions. This skill ensures consistency across the entire multi-language project by following established conventions for commits, branching, dependencies, file organization, environment configuration, code review, testing, security, and documentation.
