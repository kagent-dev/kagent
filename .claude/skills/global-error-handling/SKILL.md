name: Global Error Handling
description: Implement comprehensive error handling with custom error types, proper context wrapping, and user-friendly messages across Go, Python, and TypeScript in the Kagent codebase. Use this skill when creating custom Go error types like APIError with StatusCode, Message, and wrapped Err fields, when using Go error factory functions (NewBadRequest, NewNotFound, NewInternalError) for common HTTP errors, when wrapping Go errors with context using fmt.Errorf with %w verb to maintain error chain (failed to get agent %s/%s: %w), when checking Go errors immediately after function calls and returning early, when distinguishing not found from actual errors by returning nil for gorm.ErrRecordNotFound instead of propagating as error, when implementing centralized HTTP error handling in Go using errors.As to check for custom error types and return appropriate status codes, when handling Python HTTP errors by checking for 404 status and returning None instead of raising (treat not found as special case), when using Python try-except-finally pattern to ensure cleanup happens in finally block even if errors occur, when implementing Python validation with Pydantic validators that raise ValueError with clear messages, when implementing graceful degradation in Python by catching serialization errors and falling back to string representation, when logging Python exceptions with exc_info=True to include full stack traces for debugging, when implementing TypeScript/React API error handling that returns {data?, error?} tuples instead of throwing, when handling React component errors in useEffect with try-catch-finally to ensure loading states are reset, when implementing form validation in TypeScript that returns ValidationErrors object with field-specific error messages, when displaying inline error messages to users with role="alert" for screen readers, when implementing Next.js error boundaries with error.tsx files that show user-friendly messages with retry buttons, when using toast notifications for user feedback (toast.error, toast.success), when following the fail-fast principle by checking conditions early and returning/throwing immediately, when adding meaningful context to errors about what operation failed (not just raw error), when ensuring resources are cleaned up in finally blocks or Go defer statements, when distinguishing error types using custom error classes or status codes, or when logging technical error details for debugging while showing user-friendly messages in the UI. This skill ensures robust error handling across all languages with proper logging, user feedback, and resource cleanup.
