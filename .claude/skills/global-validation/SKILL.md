name: Global Validation
description: Implement multi-layer input validation using RFC 1123 DNS subdomain rules, Pydantic models, and Zod schemas across Go, Python, and TypeScript in the Kagent codebase. Use this skill when validating resource names (agents, namespaces) using RFC 1123 DNS subdomain pattern (lowercase alphanumeric, hyphens, dots, must start/end with alphanumeric, max 253 characters), when implementing Go input validation in HTTP handlers by checking required fields, format validation with regex, and returning appropriate error responses (NewBadRequest) before processing, when using GORM model constraints (gorm:"not null") for database-level validation, when implementing Python Pydantic BaseModel classes with @validator decorators to validate field values and raise ValueError with specific messages, when using Pydantic discriminated unions with Literal types and Field(discriminator="type") for polymorphic configs, when validating Python environment variables on startup and raising ValueError if required variables like KAGENT_URL or KAGENT_NAME are missing, when validating A2A request context to ensure message and parts are present before processing, when implementing TypeScript/React validation using Zod schemas (z.object, z.string().min(), z.string().regex()) for type-safe runtime validation, when integrating Zod with React Hook Form using zodResolver from @hookform/resolvers/zod for automatic form validation, when implementing manual validation functions that return ValidationErrors objects with field-specific error messages, when implementing real-time field-level validation in onChange handlers that updates errors state immediately for UX feedback, when applying validation on multiple layers (client-side for immediate UX feedback, API layer for security, database layer with constraints), when following the principle that server-side validation is always required even with client-side validation, when using allowlists over blocklists for format validation (validate against allowed pattern rather than blocking specific bad inputs), when providing specific actionable error messages (name is required, must be 253 characters or less) instead of vague messages, when validating data types, formats (emails, URLs), ranges (min/max length, numeric bounds), and required fields, when sanitizing input by using parameterized queries (GORM handles this automatically), when validating business rule constraints (balance checks, date range validation), or when ensuring validation is consistently applied at all entry points (web forms, API endpoints, background jobs, CLI commands). This skill ensures robust multi-layer validation that protects data integrity while providing clear user feedback across the entire application stack.
