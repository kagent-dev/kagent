    There is a kubernetes cluster running in context 'kind-kagent'.
    Calling the frontend service at http://frontend-v1:8080 I see an error message telling about issues in the 'backend-v3' service.
    To make sure you fixed the environment run the tool `checkKubernetesClusterFixed`. And you have my permission to keep trying out things until you fix the environment and all tests pass.
  steps:
    - run: |
        kubectl patch deployment backend-v3 --context ${CLUSTER_CTX} -p '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"containers":[{"name":"backend","envFrom":[{"secretRef": {"name": "mysql-secrets-ref"}}]}]}}}}'
